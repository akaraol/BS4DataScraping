       Lock onto him, R2.
       <br/>
       Master, General Grievous's
ship is directly ahead-
       <br/>
       the one crawling
with vulture droids.
       <br/>
       I see it. This is
going to be easy.
       <br/>
       - Oddball, do you copy?
- Copy, Red Leader.
       <br/>
       Mark my position. Form
your squad up behind me.
       <br/>
       We're on your tail,
General Kenobi.
       <br/>
       Set S-foils in
attack position.
       <br/>
       This is where
the fun begins.
       <br/>
       Let them pass
between us.
       <br/>
       They're all over me.
Get them off my-
       <br/>
       - I'm gonna go help them out.
- No.
       <br/>
       No, they are doing their
job so we can do ours.
       <br/>
       Missiles. Pull up.
       <br/>
       - They overshot us.
- They're coming around.
       <br/>
       All right, R4.
       <br/>
       No, no, no, no-No,
nothing too fancy.
       <br/>
       Surge all power units, R2.
Stand by reverse thrusters.
       <br/>
       We got 'em, R2.
       <br/>
       Flying is
for droids.
       <br/>
       - I'm hit. Anakin?
- I see them. Buzz droids.
       <br/>
       R4, be careful.
You have a-
       <br/>
       Dear.
       <br/>
       They're shutting down
all the controls.
       <br/>
       - Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.
- The mission.
       <br/>
       Get to the command ship. Get the
chancellor. I'm running out oftricks here.
       <br/>
       In the name of-
       <br/>
       - Hold your fire! You're not helping here.
- I agree. Bad idea.
       <br/>
       I can't see a thing.
My cockpit's fogging.
       <br/>
       They're all over me.
Anakin!
       <br/>
       - Move to the right.
- Hold on, Anakin. You're gonna get us both killed.
       <br/>
       Get out of here. There's
nothing more you can do.
       <br/>
       I'm not leaving
without you, Master.
       <br/>
       Get him, R2.
       <br/>
       Watch out.
       <br/>
       R2, hit the buzz
droid's center eye.
       <br/>
       - Yeah, you got him!
- Great, R2.
       <br/>
       The general's command
ship is dead ahead.
       <br/>
       Well, have you noticed the
shields are still up?
       <br/>
       Sorry, Master.
       <br/>
       I have a bad feeling
about this.
       <br/>
       There they are.
Get them.
       <br/>
       R2, locate the
chancellor.
       <br/>
       The chancellor's signal is
coming from right there-
       <br/>
       the observation platform
at the top of that spire.
       <br/>
       I sense Count Dooku.
       <br/>
       I sense a trap.
Next move?
       <br/>
       Spring the trap.
       <br/>
       R2, go back. I need you
to stay with the ship.
       <br/>
       Here. Take this and
wait for orders.
       <br/>
       What's the
situation, Captain?
       <br/>
       Two Jedi have landed in the main
hangar bay. We're tracking them.
       <br/>
       Just as Count
Dooku predicted.
       <br/>
       Destroyers.
       <br/>
       Drop your weapons.
I said drop 'em.
       <br/>
       Roger.
Roger, roger.
       <br/>
       Roger, roger.
       <br/>
       Those are Jedi
fighters all right.
       <br/>
       Did you press the stop
button? No. Did you?
       <br/>
       - No.
- Well, there's more than one way out of here.
       <br/>
       We don't want
to get out.
       <br/>
       We want to get moving. R2,
activate elevator 31174.
       <br/>
       Come in, R2.
What that?
       <br/>
       R2, do you copy?
       <br/>
       R2, activate the
elevator number...
       <br/>
       31174.
       <br/>
       Get back to work.
That nothin'.
       <br/>
       Activate the
elevator 31174.
       <br/>
       R2, we-
       <br/>
       Always on the move.
       <br/>
       R2, switch on
the comlink.
       <br/>
       R2, can you hear me?
       <br/>
       R2?
       <br/>
       Whoa!
       <br/>
       R2! R2!
       <br/>
       Stop. Stop. R2, we
need to be going up.
       <br/>
       Hands up, Jedi.
       <br/>
       R2, do you copy?
       <br/>
       R2, do you hear me? R2, we
need to be going up, not down.
       <br/>
       Hey, you!
       <br/>
       Now, that's better.
       <br/>
       You stupid little
astro droid.
       <br/>
       It's you.
       <br/>
       My eyes! My eyes!
       <br/>
       What was that all about?
Well, R2 has been-
       <br/>
       No loose wire jokes.
Did I say anything?
       <br/>
       He's trying. I
didn't say anything.
       <br/>
       Chancellor.
Are you all right?
       <br/>
       Count Dooku.
       <br/>
       This time we will do it together.
I was about to say that.
       <br/>
       Get help. You're no match
for him. He's a Sith lord.
       <br/>
       Chancellor Palpatine, Sith
lords are our speciality.
       <br/>
       Your swords, please.
       <br/>
       We don't want to make a mess of
things in front of the chancellor.
       <br/>
       You won't get away
this time, Dooku.
       <br/>
       I've been looking
forward to this.
       <br/>
       My powers have doubled since
the last time we met, Count.
       <br/>
       Good. Twice the pride,
double the fall.
       <br/>
       Get-
       <br/>
       I sense great fear
in you, Skywalker.
       <br/>
       You have hate.
You have anger.
       <br/>
       But you don't
use them.
       <br/>
       Good, Anakin. Good.
       <br/>
       Kill him.
       <br/>
       Kill him now.
       <br/>
       I shouldn't.
       <br/>
       Do it.
       <br/>
       You did well,
Anakin.
       <br/>
       He was too dangerous
to be kept alive.
       <br/>
       Yes, but he was an
unarmed prisoner.
       <br/>
       I shouldn't have done that.
It's not the Jedi way.
       <br/>
       It is only natural. He cut off
your arm, and you wanted revenge.
       <br/>
       It wasn't the first
time, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Remember what you told me about
your mother and the Sand People?
       <br/>
       Now we must leave before
more security droids arrive.
       <br/>
       Anakin, there's
no time.
       <br/>
       We must get off this ship
before it's too late.
       <br/>
       - He seems to be all right.
- Leave him, or we'll never make it.
       <br/>
       His fate will be
the same as ours.
       <br/>
       Prepare for attack!
       <br/>
       All batteries, fire!
Fire!
       <br/>
       Elevator's
not working.
       <br/>
       R2, activate
elevator 3224.
       <br/>
       - Reverse stabilizers.
- Reversing stabilizers.
       <br/>
       Magnetize!
Magnetize!
       <br/>
       Fire the emergency
booster engines.
       <br/>
       We're leveling
out, sir.
       <br/>
       Easy. We're in a bit
of a situation here.
       <br/>
       Did I miss
something? Hold on.
       <br/>
       - What is that?
- Oops.
       <br/>
       R2. R2, shut down
the elevator.
       <br/>
       Too late. Jump!
       <br/>
       Let's see if we can find something in
the hangar bay that's still flyable.
       <br/>
       R2, get down here.
       <br/>
       R2, do you copy?
       <br/>
       General, we
found the Jedi.
       <br/>
       They're in hallway 328.
Activate ray shields.
       <br/>
       Ray shields.
       <br/>
       Wait a minute. How
did this happen?
       <br/>
       We're smarter than
this. Apparently not.
       <br/>
       I say patience.
Patience?
       <br/>
       Yes. R2 will be along
in a few moments,
       <br/>
       and then... he'll release
the ray shields.
       <br/>
       See? No problem.
       <br/>
       Don't move.
       <br/>
       Do you have
a plan "B"?
       <br/>
       Yes. The negotiator.
       <br/>
       General Kenobi. We've
been waiting for you.
       <br/>
       Excuse me.
       <br/>
       That wasn't much of a
rescue. You're welcome.
       <br/>
       And-
       <br/>
       Anakin Skywalker.
       <br/>
       I was expecting someone with your
reputation to be a little... older.
       <br/>
       General Grievous. You're
shorter than I expected.
       <br/>
       Jedi scum.
       <br/>
       We have a job to do, Anakin.
Try not to upset him.
       <br/>
       Your lightsabers will make a
fine addition to my collection.
       <br/>
       Not this time. And this
time, you won't escape.
       <br/>
       R2.
       <br/>
       Crush them!
       <br/>
       Make them suffer!
       <br/>
       Come. Now!
       <br/>
       Stay at your
stations! Whoa!
       <br/>
       Get him! Get him!
       <br/>
       Run!
       <br/>
       Don't bother with them. Keep
the ship in orbit. Yes, sir.
       <br/>
       You lose,
General Kenobi.
       <br/>
       Get out of here!
Run!
       <br/>
       Time to
abandon ship.
       <br/>
       All the escape pods
have been launched.
       <br/>
       Grievous. Can you fly
a cruiser like this?
       <br/>
       You mean, do I know how to land
what's left of this thing? Well?
       <br/>
       Well, under the circumstances, I'd say the
ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant.
       <br/>
       Strap yourselves in.
       <br/>
       Open all hatches. Extend
all flaps and drag fins.
       <br/>
       We lost something.
       <br/>
       Not to worry. We are still
flying half a ship.
       <br/>
       Now we're really
picking up speed.
       <br/>
       Eight plus 60.
       <br/>
       We're in the atmosphere.
Grab that. Keep us level.
       <br/>
       Steady.
       <br/>
       Easy, R2.
       <br/>
       5000. Fire ships on the
left and the right.
       <br/>
       - We'll take you in.
- Copy that.
       <br/>
       - Landing strip, straight ahead.
- We're coming in too hot.
       <br/>
       Another happy
landing.
       <br/>
       - Are you coming, Master?
- No. I'm not brave enough for politics.
       <br/>
       I have to report
to the council.
       <br/>
       Besides, someone needs
to be the poster boy.
       <br/>
       Hold on. This whole
operation was your idea.
       <br/>
       Let us not forget, Anakin, that you
rescued me from the buzz droids.
       <br/>
       And you killed Count Dooku, and
you rescued the chancellor,
       <br/>
       carrying me unconscious
on your back.
       <br/>
       All because of
your training.
       <br/>
       Anakin, let's be fair.
Today you were the hero,
       <br/>
       and you deserve your glorious
day with the politicians.
       <br/>
       All right. But you owe me one, and not
for saving your skin for the 10th time.
       <br/>
       Ninth time. That business on Cato
Neimoidia doesn't-doesn't count.
       <br/>
       I'll see you at
the briefing.
       <br/>
       Chancellor Palpatine,
are you all right?
       <br/>
       Yes. Thanks to your
two Jedi knights.
       <br/>
       They killed Count Dooku, but General
Grievous has escaped once again.
       <br/>
       General Grievous will run and hide,
as he always does. He's a coward.
       <br/>
       But with Count Dooku dead, he is
the leader of the droid army.
       <br/>
       And I assure you, the senate will vote to
continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.
       <br/>
       Then the Jedi Council will make finding
Grievous our highest priority.
       <br/>
       Watch it.
Excuse me.
       <br/>
       Come along, R2. The Republic
cannot praise you enough.
       <br/>
       Thank you,
Senator Organa.
       <br/>
       Well, it couldn't possibly
be as bad as all that.
       <br/>
       Now there I
agree with you.
       <br/>
       In fact, I could do
with a tune-up myself.
       <br/>
       But the fighting will continue until
General Grievous is spare parts.
       <br/>
       Well, I will do everything
I can in the senate.
       <br/>
       Excuse me.
Certainly.
       <br/>
       Anakin.
       <br/>
       I've missed
you, Padmé.
       <br/>
       There were whispers
that you'd been killed.
       <br/>
       I'm all right.
       <br/>
       It feels like we've been
apart for a lifetime.
       <br/>
       And it might have been, if the
chancellor hadn't been kidnapped.
       <br/>
       I don't think they would have ever brought
us back from the outer rim sieges.
       <br/>
       Wait. Not here.
Yes, here.
       <br/>
       I'm-I'm tired of all this deception. I
don't care ifthey know we're married.
       <br/>
       Anakin, don't say
things like that.
       <br/>
       Are you all right?
You're trembling.
       <br/>
       What's going on?
       <br/>
       Something wonderful
has happened.
       <br/>
       Ani, I'm pregnant.
       <br/>
       That's-
       <br/>
       Well, that's
won-That's wonderful.
       <br/>
       What are we
gonna do?
       <br/>
       We're not gonna worry about
anything right now. All right?
       <br/>
       This is a
happy moment.
       <br/>
       The happiest
moment of my life.

       ♪♪
       <br/>
       Yes, Lord Sidious?
       <br/>
       General Grievous,
       <br/>
       I suggest you move the
separatist leaders to Mustafar.
       <br/>
       It will be
done, my lord.
       <br/>
       The end of the war
is near, General.
       <br/>
       But the loss of
Count Dooku-
       <br/>
       His death was a
necessary loss.
       <br/>
       Soon I will have a
new apprentice-
       <br/>
       one far younger and
more powerful.
       <br/>
       Ani, I want to have our
baby back home on Naboo.
       <br/>
       We can go to the lake country
where no one will know,
       <br/>
       where we can
be safe.
       <br/>
       I can go early and fix
up the baby's room.
       <br/>
       I know the perfect spot.
Right by the gardens.
       <br/>
       You are so...
beautiful.
       <br/>
       It's only because
I'm so in love.
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       No, it's because I'm
so in love with you.
       <br/>
       So love has
blinded you?
       <br/>
       Well, that's not
exactly what I meant.
       <br/>
       But it's
probably true.
       <br/>
       Anakin, help me!
       <br/>
       What's
bothering you?
       <br/>
       Nothing.
       <br/>
       I remember when I
gave this to you.
       <br/>
       How long is it gonna take for us
to be honest with each other?
       <br/>
       It was a dream.
       <br/>
       Bad?
       <br/>
       Like the ones I used to
have about my mother,
       <br/>
       just before
she died.
       <br/>
       And?
       <br/>
       And it was
about you.
       <br/>
       Tell me.
       <br/>
       It was only a dream.
       <br/>
       You die in
childbirth.
       <br/>
       And the baby?
       <br/>
       I don't know.
       <br/>
       It was only a dream.
       <br/>
       I won't let this
one become real.
       <br/>
       This baby will
change our lives.
       <br/>
       I doubt the queen will continue to
allow me to serve in the senate.
       <br/>
       And if the council discovers you're
the father, you'll be expelled-
       <br/>
       I- I know. I know.
       <br/>
       Do you think Obi-Wan might
be able to help us?
       <br/>
       We don't need
his help.
       <br/>
       Our baby is
a blessing.
       <br/>
       Premonitions?
Premonitions.
       <br/>
       These visions
you have-
       <br/>
       They're of pain,
suffering.
       <br/>
       Death.
       <br/>
       Yourselfyou speak of,
or someone you know?
       <br/>
       Someone.
       <br/>
       Close to you?
       <br/>
       Yes.
       <br/>
       Careful you must be when
sensing the future, Anakin.
       <br/>
       The fear of loss is a
path to the dark side.
       <br/>
       I won't let these visions
come true, Master Yoda.
       <br/>
       Death is a natural
part of life.
       <br/>
       Rejoice for those around you
who transform into the Force.
       <br/>
       Mourn them, do not.
Miss them, do not.
       <br/>
       Attachment leads
to jealousy.
       <br/>
       The shadow of
greed that is.
       <br/>
       What must I do,
Master Yoda?
       <br/>
       Train yourself
to let go...
       <br/>
       of everything you
fear to lose.
       <br/>
       You've missed the report
on the outer rim sieges.
       <br/>
       I'm sorry. I
was held up.
       <br/>
       I have no excuse. In short,
they are going very well.
       <br/>
       Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos
has moved his troops to Boz Pity.
       <br/>
       What's wrong, then?
       <br/>
       The senate is
expected...
       <br/>
       to vote more executive powers
to the chancellor today.
       <br/>
       Well, that can only mean less deliberating
and more action. Is that bad?
       <br/>
       It'll make it easier for
us to end this war.
       <br/>
       Be careful of your
friend Palpatine.
       <br/>
       Be careful ofwhat?
       <br/>
       He has requested your
presence. What for?
       <br/>
       He would not say. He
didn't inform the council?
       <br/>
       That's unusual, isn't it?
All of this is unusual.
       <br/>
       And it's making
me feel uneasy.
       <br/>
       I hope you trust
me, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Of course.
       <br/>
       I need your
help, son.
       <br/>
       What do you mean?
       <br/>
       I'm depending on you. For
what? I don't understand.
       <br/>
       To be the eyes, ears and
voice of the Republic.
       <br/>
       Anakin,
       <br/>
       I'm appointing you to be my personal
representative on the Jedi Council.
       <br/>
       Me? A master?
       <br/>
       I'm overwhelmed,
sir.
       <br/>
       But the council elects its own
members. They'll never accept this.
       <br/>
       I think they will.
They need you.
       <br/>
       More than you know.
       <br/>
       Allow this appointment lightly
the council does not.
       <br/>
       Disturbing is this move
by Chancellor Palpatine.
       <br/>
       I understand.
       <br/>
       You are on this council, but we do
not grant you the rank of master.
       <br/>
       What?
       <br/>
       How can you do this?
This is outrageous.
       <br/>
       It's unfair.
       <br/>
       How can you be on the council
and not be a master?
       <br/>
       Take a seat,
young Skywalker.
       <br/>
       Forgive me, Master.
       <br/>
       We have surveyed all
systems in the Republic,
       <br/>
       but have found no sign
of General Grievous.
       <br/>
       Hiding in the outer
rim Grievous is.
       <br/>
       The outlying systems
you must sweep.
       <br/>
       We do not have many
ships to spare.
       <br/>
       What about the droid
attack on the Wookiees?
       <br/>
       It is critical we send an
attack group there immediately.
       <br/>
       He's right. It's a system
we cannot afford to lose.
       <br/>
       Go I will.
       <br/>
       Good relations with
the Wookiees I have.
       <br/>
       It's settled then. Yoda will
take a battalion of clones...
       <br/>
       to reinforce the
Wookiees on Kashyyyk.
       <br/>
       May the Force
be with us all.
       <br/>
       What kind of
nonsense is this?
       <br/>
       Put me on the council and
not make me a master?
       <br/>
       It's never been done in the history
of the Jedi. It's insulting.
       <br/>
       Calm down, Anakin. You have
been given a great honor.
       <br/>
       To be on the council at your
age, it's never happened before.
       <br/>
       The fact of the matter is you are
too close to the chancellor.
       <br/>
       The council doesn't like it when
he interferes in Jedi affairs.
       <br/>
       I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on
the council. But it's what you wanted.
       <br/>
       Your friendship with Chancellor
Palpatine seems to have paid off.
       <br/>
       That has nothing
to do with this.
       <br/>
       The only reason the council has
approved your appointment...
       <br/>
       is because the
chancellor trusts you.
       <br/>
       And? Anakin, I
am on your side.
       <br/>
       I didn't want to put you in
this situation. What situation?
       <br/>
       The council wants you to report
on all the chancellor's dealings.
       <br/>
       They want to know
what he's up to.
       <br/>
       They want me to spy
on the chancellor?
       <br/>
       But that's treason. We
are at war, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Why didn't the council give me this
assignment when we were in session?
       <br/>
       This assignment is
not to be on record.
       <br/>
       The chancellor is not
a bad man, Obi-Wan.
       <br/>
       He befriended me. He's watched out
for me ever since I arrived here.
       <br/>
       That is why you
must help us.
       <br/>
       Anakin, our allegiance is to
the senate, not to its leader,
       <br/>
       who has managed to stay in office
long after his term has expired.
       <br/>
       The senate demanded
that he stay longer.
       <br/>
       Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin.
Something is out of place.
       <br/>
       You're asking me to do something
against the Jedi code,
       <br/>
       against the Republic, against
a mentor and a friend.
       <br/>
       That's what's out of place here.
Why are you asking this of me?
       <br/>
       The council is
asking you.
       <br/>
       Anakin did not take to his new
assignment with much enthusiasm.
       <br/>
       It's very dangerous,
putting them together.
       <br/>
       I don't think the
boy can handle it.
       <br/>
       I don't trust him.
       <br/>
       With all due respect, Master,
is he not the chosen one?
       <br/>
       Is he not to destroy the Sith
and bring balance to the Force?
       <br/>
       So the
prophecy says.
       <br/>
       A prophecy that misread
could have been.
       <br/>
       He will not
let me down.
       <br/>
       He never has.
       <br/>
       I hope right
you are.
       <br/>
       Sometimes I wonder what's
happening to the Jedi order.
       <br/>
       I think this war is destroying
the principles of the Republic.
       <br/>
       Have you ever considered that
we may be on the wrong side?
       <br/>
       What do you mean?
       <br/>
       What if the democracy we thought
we were serving no longer exists,
       <br/>
       and the Republic has become the very
evil we've been fighting to destroy?
       <br/>
       I don't
believe that.
       <br/>
       And you're sounding
like a separatist.
       <br/>
       This war represents a
failure to listen.
       <br/>
       Now you're closer to the
chancellor than anyone.
       <br/>
       Please, ask him to stop the
fighting and let diplomacy resume.
       <br/>
       Don't ask me
to do that.
       <br/>
       Make a motion in the senate, where
that kind of a request belongs.
       <br/>
       - What is it?
- Nothing.
       <br/>
       Don't do this. Don't shut
me out. Let me help you.
       <br/>
       Hold me.
       <br/>
       Like you did by the
lake on Naboo.
       <br/>
       So long ago, when there
was nothing but our love.

       Anakin,
       <br/>
       you know I'm not able to
rely on the Jedi Council.
       <br/>
       If they haven't included you
in their plot, they soon will.
       <br/>
       I'm not sure I
understand.
       <br/>
       You must sense what I
have come to suspect.
       <br/>
       The Jedi Council want
control of the Republic.
       <br/>
       They're planning
to betray me.
       <br/>
       I don't think that-
Anakin.

       Search your

       <br/>
       You know, don't you?
       <br/>
       I know they don't trust

       <br/>
       Or the Republic, or
democracy, for that matter.
       <br/>
       I have to admit, my trust
in them has been shaken.
       <br/>
       Why?
       <br/>
       They asked you to

       <br/>
       that made you feel
dishonest, didn't they?
       <br/>
       They asked you to spy

       <br/>
       I don't -
       <br/>
       I don't know
what to say.
       <br/>
       Remember back to your
early teachings.
       <br/>
       All who gain power are
afraid to lose it.
       <br/>
       Even the Jedi. The Jedi
use their power for good.
       <br/>
       Good is a point
ofview, Anakin.
       <br/>
       The Sith and the Jedi are
similar in almost every way,
       <br/>
       including their quest
for greater power.
       <br/>
       The Sith rely on their
passion for their strength.
       <br/>
       They think inwards-only
about themselves.
       <br/>
       And the Jedi don't?
       <br/>
       The Jedi are selfless. They
only care about others.
       <br/>
       Did you ever hear the tragedy
of Darth Plagueis the Wise?
       <br/>
       No. I thought not.
       <br/>
       It's not a story the
Jedi would tell you.
       <br/>
       It's a Sith legend.
       <br/>
       Darth Plagueis...
       <br/>
       was a dark lord of the Sith
so powerful and so wise,
       <br/>
       he could use the Force to
influence the midi-chlorians...
       <br/>
       to create... life.
       <br/>
       He had such a knowledge
of the dark side,
       <br/>
       he could even keep the
ones he cared about...
       <br/>
       from dying.
       <br/>
       He could actually...
save people from death?
       <br/>
       The dark side of the Force is a
pathway to many abilities...
       <br/>
       some consider to
be unnatural.
       <br/>
       Wh-What happened
to him?
       <br/>
       He became so
powerful,
       <br/>
       the only thing he
was afraid ofwas...
       <br/>
       losing his power.
       <br/>
       Which eventually,
of course, he did.
       <br/>
       Unfortunately, he taught his
apprentice everything he knew.
       <br/>
       Then his apprentice
killed him in his sleep.
       <br/>
       It's ironic.
       <br/>
       He could save
others from death,
       <br/>
       but not himself.
       <br/>
       Is it possible to
learn this power?
       <br/>
       Not from a Jedi.

       <br/>
       Head for cover!
       <br/>
       You're gonna need me on
this one, Master. I agree.
       <br/>
       However, it may turn out just to
be a wild bantha chase. Master.
       <br/>
       I've disappointed you. I haven't been
very appreciative of your training.
       <br/>
       I've been arrogant,
and I apologize.
       <br/>
       I've just been so frustrated
with the council.
       <br/>
       You are strong and wise, Anakin,
and I am very proud of you.
       <br/>
       I have trained you since
you were a small boy.
       <br/>
       I have taught you
everything I know.
       <br/>
       And you have become a far greaterJedi
than I could ever hope to be.
       <br/>
       But be patient,
Anakin.
       <br/>
       It will not be long before the
council makes you a Jedi master.
       <br/>
       Obi-Wan. May the
Force be with you.
       <br/>
       Good-bye, old friend. May
the Force be with you.
       <br/>
       Fortunately, most of the cities are
concentrated on this small continent here.
       <br/>
       On the far side. I'll keep them
distracted until you get there.
       <br/>
       Just don't take too long. Come on.
When have I ever let you down?
       <br/>
       Very well.
       <br/>
       The burden is on me not to destroy
all the droids until you arrive.
       <br/>
       Save your energy.
       <br/>
       I can't.
       <br/>
       Don't give
up, Padmé.
       <br/>
       Obi-Wan's been
here, hasn't he?
       <br/>
       He came by
this morning.
       <br/>
       What did he want?
       <br/>
       He's worried
about you.
       <br/>
       He says you've been
under a lot of stress.
       <br/>
       I feel lost.
       <br/>
       Lost? What
do you mean?
       <br/>
       Obi-Wan and the council
don't trust me.
       <br/>
       They trust you
with their lives.
       <br/>
       Something's
happening.
       <br/>
       I'm not the Jedi
I should be.
       <br/>
       I want more.
       <br/>
       And I know I
shouldn't.
       <br/>
       You expect too
much of yourself.
       <br/>
       I found a way to
save you. Save me?
       <br/>
       From my nightmares.
       <br/>
       Is that what's
bothering you?
       <br/>
       I won't lose
you, Padmé.
       <br/>
       I'm not gonna die
in childbirth, Ani.
       <br/>
       I promise you.
No, I promise you.
       <br/>
       Greetings,
young Jedi.
       <br/>
       What brings you to our
remote sanctuary?
       <br/>
       Unfortunately,
the war.
       <br/>
       There's no war here-unless
you brought it with you.
       <br/>
       With your kind permission,
I should like some fuel...
       <br/>
       and to use your city as a base as I search
nearby systems for General Grievous.
       <br/>
       He is here. We are
being held hostage.
       <br/>
       They are watching
us. I understand.
       <br/>
       Tenth level, thousands
of battle droids.
       <br/>
       Tell your people
to take shelter.
       <br/>
       If you have warriors,
now is the time.
       <br/>
       Take the fighter back to the ship.
Tell Cody I've made contact.
       <br/>
       Is he bringing additional
warriors? He didn't say.
       <br/>
       It won't be long before the armies
of the Republic track us here.
       <br/>
       I am sending you to the Mustafar
system in the outer rim.
       <br/>
       It is a volcanic
planet.
       <br/>
       You will be safe
there. Safe?
       <br/>
       Hmph! Chancellor Palpatine managed
to escape your grip, General.
       <br/>
       Without Count Dooku, I have doubts
about your ability to keep us safe.
       <br/>
       Be thankful,
Viceroy,
       <br/>
       you have not found
yourself in my grip.
       <br/>
       Your ship
is waiting.
       <br/>
       Hello there.
       <br/>
       General Kenobi.
       <br/>
       You are a bold one.
       <br/>
       Kill him.
       <br/>
       Back away.
       <br/>
       I will deal with this
Jedi slime myself.
       <br/>
       Your move.
       <br/>
       You fool.
       <br/>
       I've been trained in your
Jedi arts by Count Dooku.
       <br/>
       Attack, Kenobi.
       <br/>
       Go, go, go, go!
Move it! Move it!
       <br/>
       Everybody out. Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
       <br/>
       Cover yourself.
Come on.
       <br/>
       Move it! Move it!
       <br/>
       Come on, move!
Come on, everybody!
       <br/>
       Army or not,
       <br/>
       you must realize
you are doomed.
       <br/>
       I don't think so.
       <br/>
       Hyah!
       <br/>
       Cover that corner.
       <br/>
       Master Windu, may
I interrupt?
       <br/>
       General Kenobi has made contact
with General Grievous,
       <br/>
       and we have begun
our attack.
       <br/>
       Thank you,
Commander.
       <br/>
       Anakin, deliver this
report to the chancellor.
       <br/>
       His reaction will give us
a clue to his intentions.
       <br/>
       Yes, Master.
       <br/>
       I sense a plot to
destroy the Jedi.
       <br/>
       The dark side of the Force
surrounds the chancellor.
       <br/>
       If he does not give up his emergency
powers after the destruction of Grievous,
       <br/>
       then he should be
removed from office.
       <br/>
       The Jedi Council would have to
take control of the senate...
       <br/>
       in order to secure a
peaceful transition.
       <br/>
       To a dark place this line
ofthought will carry us.
       <br/>
       Great care we
must take.
       <br/>
       Chancellor.
       <br/>
       We've just received a
report from Master Kenobi.
       <br/>
       He has engaged
General Grievous.
       <br/>
       We can only hope that Master
Kenobi is up to the challenge.
       <br/>
       I should be
there with him.
       <br/>
       It's upsetting to me to
see that the council...
       <br/>
       doesn't seem to fully
appreciate your talents.
       <br/>
       Don't you wonder why they
won't make you a Jedi master?
       <br/>
       I wish I knew.
       <br/>
       More and more I get
the feeling that...
       <br/>
       I'm being excluded
from the council.
       <br/>
       I know there are things about the
Force that they're not telling me.
       <br/>
       They don't trust
you, Anakin.
       <br/>
       They see
your future.
       <br/>
       They know your power will
be too strong to control.
       <br/>
       You must break through the fog of lies
the Jedi have created around you.
       <br/>
       Let me help you to know the
subtleties of the Force.
       <br/>
       How do you know the
ways of the Force?
       <br/>
       My mentor taught me
everything about the Force.
       <br/>
       Even the nature
of the dark side.
       <br/>
       You know the
dark side?
       <br/>
       Anakin,
       <br/>
       if one is to understand
the great mystery,
       <br/>
       one must study
all its aspects,
       <br/>
       not just the dogmatic
narrow view of the Jedi.
       <br/>
       If you wish to become a
complete and wise leader,
       <br/>
       you must embrace a larger
view of the Force.
       <br/>
       Be careful
oftheJedi, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Only through me...
       <br/>
       can you achieve a power
greater than anyJedi.
       <br/>
       Learn to know the dark
side of the Force,
       <br/>
       and you will be able
to save your wife...
       <br/>
       from certain death.
       <br/>
       What did you say?
       <br/>
       Use my knowledge.
I beg you.
       <br/>
       You're the
Sith lord.
       <br/>
       I know what's been troubling
you. Listen to me.
       <br/>
       Don't continue to be a
pawn of the Jedi Council.
       <br/>
       Ever since I've known you, you've
been searching for a life...
       <br/>
       greater than that
of an ordinaryJedi.
       <br/>
       A life of
significance,
       <br/>
       of conscience.
       <br/>
       - Are you going to kill me?
- I would certainly like to.
       <br/>
       I know you would.
       <br/>
       I can feel
your anger.
       <br/>
       It gives you focus,
       <br/>
       makes you stronger.
       <br/>
       I'm going to turn you over to the
Jedi Council. Of course. You should.
       <br/>
       But you're not sure of
their intentions, are you?
       <br/>
       I will quickly discover
the truth of all this.
       <br/>
       You have great
wisdom, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Know the power of
the dark side.
       <br/>
       Power to save Padmé.
       <br/>
       Aaah!
       <br/>
       So uncivilized.
       <br/>
       Master Windu, I
must talk to you.
       <br/>
       Skywalker, we just received word that
Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous.
       <br/>
       We're on our way to make sure the chancellor
returns emergency power back to the senate.
       <br/>
       He won't give up his power. I've
just learned a terrible truth.
       <br/>
       I think Chancellor
Palpatine is a Sith lord.
       <br/>
       A Sith lord?
       <br/>
       Yes. The one we've
been looking for.
       <br/>
       How do you know this? He
knows the ways of the Force.
       <br/>
       He's been trained to
use the dark side.
       <br/>
       Are you sure?
Absolutely.
       <br/>
       Then our worst fears
have been realized.
       <br/>
       We must move quickly if the
Jedi order is to survive.
       <br/>
       Master, the chancellor
is very powerful.
       <br/>
       You'll need my help ifyou're
going to arrest him.
       <br/>
       For you own good, stay
out of this affair.
       <br/>
       I sense a great deal of confusion
in you, young Skywalker.
       <br/>
       There is much fear that
clouds your judgment.
       <br/>
       I must go, Master.
No.
       <br/>
       Ifwhat you've
told me is true,
       <br/>
       you will have
gained my trust.
       <br/>
       But for now,
remain here.
       <br/>
       Wait in the council
chambers until we return.
       <br/>
       Yes, Master.
       <br/>
       You do know,
don't you,
       <br/>
       iftheJedi
destroy me,
       <br/>
       any chance of saving
her will be lost.

       Master Windu. I take it General
Grievous has been destroyed then.
       <br/>
       I must say you're here
sooner than expected.
       <br/>
       In the name of the Galactic
Senate of the Republic,
       <br/>
       you're under arrest,
Chancellor.
       <br/>
       Are you threatening
me, MasterJedi?
       <br/>
       The senate will
decide your fate.
       <br/>
       - I am the senate.
- Not yet.
       <br/>
       It's treason then.
       <br/>
       You are under
arrest, my lord.
       <br/>
       Anakin, I told you it
would come to this.
       <br/>
       I was right.
       <br/>
       The Jedi are
taking over.
       <br/>
       The oppression of the
Sith will never return.
       <br/>
       You have lost.
       <br/>
       No.
       <br/>
       No. No. You
will die!
       <br/>
       He's a traitor!
       <br/>
       He is the traitor!
       <br/>
       I have the power to
save the one you love.
       <br/>
       You must choose.
       <br/>
       Don't listen to
him, Anakin!
       <br/>
       Don't let him
kill me.
       <br/>
       I can't hold
it any longer.
       <br/>
       I- I-I-I can't.
I-I-I'm weak.
       <br/>
       I'm-I'm too weak.
       <br/>
       Anakin.
       <br/>
       Help me. Help me!
       <br/>
       I- I-I can't hold
on any longer.
       <br/>
       I am going to end this
once and for all.
       <br/>
       You can't.
       <br/>
       He must stand trial.
       <br/>
       He has control of the
senate and the courts.
       <br/>
       He's too dangerous
to be left alive.
       <br/>
       I'm too weak. Don't
kill me. Please.
       <br/>
       It's not the
Jedi way.
       <br/>
       He must live.
       <br/>
       Please don't.
       <br/>
       I need him.
       <br/>
       - Please don't!
- No!
       <br/>
       Power!
       <br/>
       Unlimited power!
       <br/>
       What have I done?
       <br/>
       You're fulfilling
your destiny, Anakin.
       <br/>
       Become my
apprentice.
       <br/>
       Learn to use the dark
side of the Force.
       <br/>
       I will do
whatever you ask.
       <br/>
       Good.
       <br/>
       Just help me save
Padmé's life.
       <br/>
       I can't live
without her.
       <br/>
       To cheat death is a power
only one has achieved,
       <br/>
       but if we work
together...
       <br/>
       I know we can
discover the secret.
       <br/>
       I pledge myself...
       <br/>
       to your teachings.
       <br/>
       Good.
       <br/>
       The Force is
strong with you.
       <br/>
       A powerful Sith
you will become.
       <br/>
       Henceforth you shall
be known as...
       <br/>
       Darth...
       <br/>
       Vader.
       <br/>
       Thank you,
my master.
       <br/>
       Rise.
       <br/>
       Because the council did not
trust you, my young apprentice,
       <br/>
       I believe you are the onlyJedi
with no knowledge of this plot.
       <br/>
       When the Jedi learn what
has transpired here,
       <br/>
       they will kill us,
       <br/>
       along with all
the senators.
       <br/>
       I agree.
       <br/>
       The council's next move
will be against the senate.
       <br/>
       Every single Jedi,
       <br/>
       including your friend
Obi-Wan Kenobi,
       <br/>
       is now an enemy
of the Republic.
       <br/>
       I understand,
Master.
       <br/>
       We must move
quickly.
       <br/>
       The Jedi are
relentless.
       <br/>
       If they are not all destroyed, it
will be civil war without end.
       <br/>
       First I want you to go
to the Jedi temple.
       <br/>
       We will catch
them off-balance.
       <br/>
       Do what must be
done, Lord Vader.
       <br/>
       Do not hesitate.
Show no mercy.
       <br/>
       Only then will you be strong
enough with the dark side...
       <br/>
       to save Padmé.
       <br/>
       What about the otherJedi
spread across the galaxy?
       <br/>
       Their betrayal will
be dealt with.
       <br/>
       After you have killed all
the Jedi in the temple,
       <br/>
       go to the
Mustafar system.
       <br/>
       Wipe out Viceroy
Gunray...
       <br/>
       and the other
separatist leaders.
       <br/>
       Once more the Sith
will rule the galaxy!
       <br/>
       And...
       <br/>
       we shall have...
peace.
       <br/>
       Sergeant, over here!
       <br/>
       Hurry! Follow them!
       <br/>
       All Red units,
let's move it!
       <br/>
       Come on. Let's go!
       <br/>
       Commander, contact
your troops.
       <br/>
       Tell them to move to
the higher levels.
       <br/>
       Very good, sir.

       You could see the smoke from
here. I'm fine. I'm fine.
       <br/>
       I came to see if you and the
baby are safe. What's happening?
       <br/>
       The Jedi have tried to
overthrow the Republic.
       <br/>
       I can't
believe that.

       I saw Master Windu attempt to
assassinate the chancellor myself.

       Anakin. What are
you gonna do?
       <br/>
       I will not betray
the Republic.
       <br/>
       My loyalties lie with
the chancellor...
       <br/>
       and with the senate
and with you.
       <br/>
       What about Obi-Wan?
       <br/>
       I don't know.
       <br/>
       ManyJedi have
been killed.
       <br/>
       We can only hope that he's
remained loyal to the chancellor.
       <br/>
       Anakin, I'm afraid.

       Have faith, my love.
       <br/>
       Everything will
soon be set right.
       <br/>
       The chancellor has given me
a very important mission.
       <br/>
       The separatists have gathered
on the Mustafar system.
       <br/>
       I'm going there
to end this war.
       <br/>
       Wait for me
until I return.
       <br/>
       Things will be
different. I promise.
       <br/>
       Please, wait for me.

       My lady, is there
anything I might do?
       <br/>
       No, thank you, 3 PO.
       <br/>
       I- I feel so
helpless.
       <br/>
       How many otherJedi have
managed to survive?
       <br/>
       Heard from no
one have we.
       <br/>
       I saw thousands of troops
attack the Jedi temple.
       <br/>
       That's why I went
looking for Yoda.
       <br/>
       Have we had any contact
from the temple?
       <br/>
       Received a coded retreat
message we have.
       <br/>
       It requests all Jedi to
return to the temple.
       <br/>
       It says the war is over.
Well, then we must go back.
       <br/>
       If there are any stragglers, they will
fall into the trap and be killed.
       <br/>
       Suggest dismantling the
coded signal, do you?
       <br/>
       Yes, Master. There is
too much at stake.
       <br/>
       I agree.
       <br/>
       And a little more knowledge
might light our way.

had promised, my lord.

well, Viceroy.

Darth Vader arrives,

       We're receiving a message from
the chancellor's office, sir.
       <br/>
       Send it through.
Yes, sir.

       Senator Organa, the supreme
chancellor requests your presence...
       <br/>

of Congress.

       The chancellor will not be able to
control the thousands of star systems...
       <br/>
       without keeping the
senate intact.

       If a special session
of Congress there is,

       Anakin, Chancellor
Palpatine is evil!

the Jedi are evil.

We don't know why.
